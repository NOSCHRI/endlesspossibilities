      <h1>Angeniet Berkers</h1>

<p>Home is where you park it</p>

<p>Angeniet Berkers is a 29 year old documentary photographer based in Rotterdam. Angeniet is particularly interested in people living in different ways other than the usual. She is at her best when she can blend into the world she is researching at that particular moment. She loves to live like her subjects and often spends one or two nights at their homes. Making these projects is therefore a great adventure.</p>

<p>Her project for Endless Expo is about people choosing to live in trucks, busses or trailers, mostly on squatted terrains. She is fascinated about the way they 'obtain' their freedom because it isn't always that easy to live this way. Sometimes it is also a kind of 'state of mind'. When you are at the point of daring to let go the common rules and standards, a special world comes to existence where everyting seems to be possible.</p>
