      <h1>Muriel Schouten</h1>

      <p>Breeding Back<br><i>The return of the Aurochs</i></p>

      <p>Muriel Schouten is a critical documentary photographer who is focussing on problematic issues in the Western-society. She is fascinated by situations where stories collide, especially within themes concerning the fragility of life. In her work she confronts her audience with the consequences of human actions, in which she approaches subjects in a new or different way to provoke her audience to stop and (re-) think.</p>

      <p>Since the last aurochs died in 1627, in the Jaktorów Forest, Poland, their genes lived on in all of today’s domesticated cattle. Now Dutch organisations are striving to reconstruct this keystone specie through selective cattle breeding. They are aiming to restore European’s wildlife and return it’s habitat to a ‘natural’ state. These are the first attempts to restore extinct species, but what will it mean for the human relation to nature when this becomes reality in the near future?</p>
