      <p>In Anticipation Of</p>

      <p>George Knegtel is a 22-year-old photographer from the Netherlands. In her work she explores human behaviour through the spaces we create. For her, a space is a human footprint; it tells us about the shape and character of our society. She has a strong fascination for themes dealing with 'identity' and 'absence'.</p>

      <p>After the Madrid train bombings of 2004 and the explosion at the chemical plant in
        Moerdijk in 2011, the question was raised on how we can prepare ourselves for such attacks and incidents. The internet has become a platform for anyone to share their 'do it yourself' recipes for small bombs, explosives and toxic gases. It has never been easier to create your own weapons from products underneath your kitchen sink. These past events and the uncertain future have made us fear a new wave of terrorism.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands responded with the building plan of a training centre that is unique to Europe. It is used for realistic training for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear disasters and incidents. This facility, the NTC CBRN in Vught, is preparing for the unknown dangers of the future.</p>
