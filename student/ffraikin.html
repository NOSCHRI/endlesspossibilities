      <p>Human And Machine<br><i>Creation of the new man machine </i></p>

      <p>Fabian Fraikin is a 20-year-old photographer from the Netherlands whose work consists of observations about new developments in society. His observations give the viewer the chance to look at unnoticed developments. </p>

      <p> His newest project  „Human and Machine” started because of his dependency on technology he is used to, now a days. He is fascinated by the evolution and the constant developments in technology. Which he don’t understand and tries to investigate. The sceneries he chooses to photograph are places where scientist working on man-made robotics. Who are working on autonomous power of robotica. The researchers want the robots be able to support themselves in our daily tasks. Now the robots get introduced to us, we must ask whether this is a positive or negative development. Are we ready for the new technologic developments? We trust technology, but what impact will this have on our society? Many questions arise to the influence of these robotics in our surrounding.  He wants the viewer gets to know his or her new friend that we do not yet understand.</p>
