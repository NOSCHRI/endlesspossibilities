      <p>Eva and Rose<br><i>Creation of the new man machine </i></p>

      <p>Fabian Fraikin is a 20-year-old photographer from The Netherlands whose work consists of observations about new developments in society. His observations give the viewer the chance to look at unnoticed developments.</p>

      <p> His newest project „Eva and Rose” started from the fascination he has for technology. He is interested in the quickly evolving technological developments because this technology holds power and control over the individual. Within his way of working he tries to investigate the technology that he doesn't understand.</p>
      <p>The sceneries he chooses to photograph are places where scientists work on man-made robotics. The scientists work on the autonomous power of robotica. They want the robots to be able to support us in our daily tasks. Now, that the robots are being introduced to us, we should ask ourselves whether this is a positive or a negative development.</p>
        <p>Are we ready for these new technologic developments? We trust technology, but what impact will it have on our society? Today there are political discussions going on regarding robots replacing human labor. Many questions arise about the influence of these robotics in our surroundings. Fabian wants the viewer to get to know his or her new friend that we do not fully understand yet.</p>
