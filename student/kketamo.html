      <h1>Karl Ketamo</h1>

      <p>See the Forest from the Trees<br><i>Representation of Nature</i></p>

      <p>Karl Ketamo is a 27-year-old photographer from Finland whose work consists of observations about the use of space in public and semi-public areas in the modern city environment. Originally from a small Finnish town, he is able to approach these new urban surroundings from the perspective of a distinctive bystander. His carefully chosen observations give the viewer an opportunity to stop, look and reflect upon developments in the modern landscape, which is often overlooked and unnoticed.</p>
      <p>His newest project “See the Forest from the Trees” ponders the relationship between painting, photography and the reconstruction of nature. The sceneries he chooses to photograph are man-made, designed areas, making the nature there a reflection of itself. He is interested in the representation of nature from a tripartite perspective regarding the reconstructed landscapes in relation to photography, painting and implementation. Do we still have genuine experiences of nature or are we living in an image of it? Are the natural settings seen in the images constructed according to an ideal image or do we perceive the landscape with the ideal in our minds? Many questions arise, leaving the viewer to contemplate the influence of images with regard to alteration of nature, the ideal and the new nature experience.</p>
