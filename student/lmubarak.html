      <h1>Laila Mubarak</h1>

      <p>Like me, love me, see me</p>

      <p>Laila Mubarak is a 35 year old Indonesian documentary photographer who is interested in the contact process that emerges between the other and her. Her subject is often the young woman. What fascinates her is body language, the little differences in the subjectsâ€™ face, in the hands etc. that unveils the subject state of mind.</p>

      <p>In Laila Mubarak's project 'Like me, Love me, See me' she studies the portrait as a reaction on the changing visual culture.  Especially among the young generation she sees a particular standard of making portraits. There seems to be a format.</p>
      <p>Adolescents are in a phase of developing identity. On one hand they tend to comply with their peers and the other hand they are trying to find their authentic selves.  </p>
      <p>Their self-portrait looks like a conformation with the prevailing visual culture. Like me, Love me, See me explores the endless possibilities of the portrait  in search of the authentic self.     </p>
