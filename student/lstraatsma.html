      <h1>Lise Straatsma</h1>

      <p>My Domain</p>

      <p>Lise Straatsma is 24-year-old photographer from Amsterdam, who is fascinated by group dynamics and being included or excluded. The friction between being part of a group and being an individual at the same time is a big theme in her work. She is most fascinated by groups that she doesn’t seem to belong to, because of her age, sex or convictions. Being a photographer is the perfect excuse to infiltrate these groups.</p>

    <p>In our society fully dependant on automatized systems, the computer seems to have the leading character. But behind the beaming faces of these machines reside their operators, ordinarily, human beings.</p>

    <p>My domain is a photographic series about a recently evolved subculture of young man in ICT. A system administrator within a company is becoming unusual whereas more and more companies hire external ICT businesses. Almost every technological problem can be solved remotely and this is why we nowadays can find office buildings filed with young operators that speak a digital language unknown to most of us.</p>
    <p>Far away from the systems, which they actually build and maintain, they sit isolated behind walls of computer screens, puttering in computer cases, focussed and undisturbed in their own domain.</p>

    <p>Although these young men play a crucial role in maintaining the systems that we usually take for granted, they might not be the typical nerds we expect them to be. From voting offices to supermarkets, they are all kept running by these young men. In this extremely fast developing professional field, it is difficult to keep up with the continuing stream of new knowledge. The youngsters become the experts and the experienced are out of date. My domain introduces us to these young men behind the screens.</p>
