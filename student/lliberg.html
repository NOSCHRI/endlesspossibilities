      <h1>Liv Liberg</h1>

      <p>ABEKE & CHIZU</p>

      <p>Liv Ylva is a 22 year old Dutch photographer and in her imagery she is inspired and fascinated by the fine line between normality and absurdity. Creating images that may look recognizable, but then appear to be totally not from this world, is something she strives for. She sees herself as a painter, using fashion as a playground to experiment with colours, patterns, forms and shapes and within this she always plays with the functions of the human body. </p>

      <p>In her latest project, Liv is working with preconceptions that people from the western world might have about foreign cultures, and she handles this concept in a visually fashion-like way.</p>

      <p>There could have been endless possibilities when people became the way they are, looking the way they look. They happened to develop certain cultures and looks, that may or may not have changed through history. In her project, Liv shows you these images of cultures through her eyes; the western perspective. She shows you how she thinks these cultures look, and mostly these are cultures far away, almost abstract in her eyes. She actually reveals how little she knows, and hopes to trigger people into realizing that they share the same perspective, and that we, in this world where everything is globalized, we are maybe not as cultured as we may think.</p>

      <p>The images that Liv wants to create will be built up from western elements, but she will strive to create something that is close to the culture itself, or at least, what she thinks they look like. She is using her fantasy to play with styling in a very new way, in order to create something that is in essence nothing real at all, but we will recognize it as something that we know. </p>
