      <h1>Maarten Broekhuizen</h1>

      <p>Terms and Conditions</p>

      <p>Maarten Broekhuizen is 25-year-old photographer from the Netherlands. His work often focuses on technological developments and the impact they have on our life. His personal concerns regarding privacy are a red line throughout his work.</p>

      <p>In his most recent project Maarten focuses on datacenters in the Netherlands. The Netherlands play an important role in gathering and storing online information. Companies like Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and most recently Google choose to store their information in the Netherlands.</p>

      <p>Curious to these locations Maarten set out to investigate the places that house the endless mass of information called the Internet. After a lot of declines and negotiating he was able to get access to the highly secured locations that collect our data. </p>

      <p>Experiencing the rules and regulations he encountered at the locations he realized it wasn’t just about his concern with his privacy. The datacenters aren’t as much taking information as we are giving it to them by using “free” software like Facebook. We are so eager to have the latest app or update that we don’t care to read the terms and conditions we agree upon by downloading the actual software.</p>

      <p>The result is a series of interiors of the places that in a way house the Internet. The Dutch Internet connection is dependent on these places. By combining ‘objective’ photographs of the interiors with short sentences from the terms and condition texts from companies like Facebook both the interiors and the text get an identity. </p>
