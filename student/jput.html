      <h1>Joppe Put</h1>

      <p>Beyond The Façade</p>

      <p>Joppe Put is a 23 years old documentary photographer. He is inspired by subjects not that far from home. With his work he shows systems behind things that seem so obvious. He wants to amaze the viewer and question how things work.</p>

      <p>The project is about the storages in stores. Joppe was inspired by the fact that it shows a totally different world then most people know. While stores try to distinguish from one another and are subject to change, the storages show the opposite. The spaces are in a way timeless. The form of the place follows function and is not there to sell. Joppe wants to question what’s left of the identity of the store behind the scene.
